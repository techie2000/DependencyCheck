Dependency-Check-Maven
=========

Dependency-Check is a utility that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within project dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the [github pages](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-maven/index.html).
