Carthage Analyzer
================

*Experimental*: This analyzer is considered experimental. While this analyzer may 
be useful and provide valid results more testing must be completed to ensure that
the false negative/false positive rates are acceptable. 

OWASP dependency-check includes an analyzer that will analyze SWIFT and Objective-C
packages by scanning [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) specification files.

Files Types Scanned: [Cartfile.resolved](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md).
