#### Example
```groovy
dependencyCheck {
    data.directory='d:/nvd'
}
```

### Analyzer Configuration

In addition to the above, the dependencyCheck plugin can be configured to enable or disable specific
analyzers by configuring the `analyzers` section. Note, specific file type analyzers will automatically
disable themselves if no file types that they support are detected - so specifically disabling the
analyzers is likely not needed.
